# Acorex
3D Audio Corpus Explorer

# Build
### Requirements

* CMake

* Something to run shell scripts in (e.g. Git Bash)

* IDE (VS for Windows, Xcode for Mac, Linux T.B.D.)

### Steps

* Clone the repo

* Run ./build-deps.sh - this will download all dependencies and OpenFrameworks

  * Optional arguments:

    * -c | force recompile

    * -d | force re-download (also forces recompile)

* Once the script is done, navigate to openframeworks/apps/myApps/acorex, run the VS or XCode solutions and build from there
